This website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features responsive web design using the Bootstrap grid system. I implemented Bootstrap 4 as the Web UI Front-end framework of choice. 

I used Bootstrap CSS Components such as  buttons, forms, tables, cards, images and media, tags, alerts and progress bars.

I also implemented Bootstrap's JavaScript components such as tabs, pills and tabbed navigation, collapse, accordion, tooltips, modals and carousels. In addition I developed CSS code using the Sass CSS preprocessor to add extra styling.

I also developed task automation for building and deployment of the project using NPM Scripts, and demonstrated the use of task runners namely Grunt and Gulp.
